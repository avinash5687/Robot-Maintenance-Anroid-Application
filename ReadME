This application is specifically designed to address the maintenance needs of robots involved in the Man-less Engine Assemble (MEA) process, with a focus on Jishu Hozen and Primitive Maintenance. As part of the MEA Application, which incorporates data tracking and visualization, the application serves as a dedicated tool for robot maintenance.

The MEA Application utilizes a considerable number of robots to autonomously assemble engine parts, eliminating the requirement for human involvement. To streamline the maintenance process, the robots are classified into four distinct subgroups, namely Sub Group 1, Sub Group 2, Sub Group 3, and potentially others depending on the total number of machines employed. For instance, if there are 30 machines, each subgroup will consist of 10 machines. These machines are further organized into stages, such as Stage 1, Stage 2, and so on, within their respective subgroups. Each stage is assigned a unique ID for easy identification and tracking.

Each machine within the application encompasses various parts, each of which necessitates specific maintenance procedures. These maintenance tasks can range from parts replacement and tool retightening to greasing, dust cleaning, and sanitizing. To ensure efficient organization and monitoring of these maintenance activities, a hierarchical structure has been implemented. Each stage is divided into different equipment categories, and within each category, sub-equipment is established to account for varying maintenance requirements. This hierarchical arrangement allows for meticulous management of the maintenance process, promoting optimal performance and longevity of the robots.

By utilizing this application, users can effectively track, visualize, and execute maintenance procedures for the robots involved in the Man-less Engine Assemble process. It provides a comprehensive solution to streamline Jishu Hozen and Primitive Maintenance, contributing to the overall efficiency and reliability of the MEA application in the assembly of engine parts.
